It was a fun experience, I will miss the cheap beers and the good fries ( Get drunk and filled for a tenner, unbeatable) . The Brick was a blast, joined it 3 days after I moved to Antwerp and would DEFINITELY recommend.</description>

      <description>There was an older version of this post previously available on this blog, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied with it as it was becoming a mess.&#xA;I have decided to only list the websites here that I have personally used, enjoyed, and would recommend to others in real life (IRL).&#xA;You just got started SQL SQLZoo: The website I usually advise to friends or colleagues who are getting started with SQL. You should become comfortable with any of those exercises.</description>

      <description>Hello, I am Hiro(to) Welcome to my page; this is my little place on the internet.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering: I was born and raised in France, but both of my parents are Japanese. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to balance these two cultures over time.&#xA;I currently work in the Tech Industry as a Data Engineer, but I initially started as a (Junior) Project Manager in the construction industry before making a significant shift in my career path.</description>
