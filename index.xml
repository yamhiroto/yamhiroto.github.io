      <description>Why this blog    You certainly ended up here while casually &amp;ndash;stalking&amp;ndash; checking my Linkedin Page and might be wondering what you will find here.
I always wanted to start a blog for several reasons:
 I thought it would be fun Like you, a lot is going on up there and I want to keep my thoughts clear and organized on some subjects. I realized I had gathered a significant amount of web resources and I wanted to start organizing them: if they are not worth sharing, they are not worth keeping I &amp;ldquo;bombed&amp;rdquo; my first carrier in my early years (I am not that old) and I want to share all the lessons learned I wish someone had told me when I first graduated I want to be able to share a page on my subjects of interest with like-minded people and maybe start interesting (non/for-profit) projects together!</description>

      <description>Hello, I am Hiro(to)    Welcome to my page, this is my little place on the internet.
If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering: I was born and bred in France, but both of my parents are Japanese. I learned how to balance those 2 cultures over time.
I currently work in the Tech Industry as a Data Engineer / Analytics Engineer, but I initially started as a (Junior) Project Manager in the construction industry before brutally shifting my career path.</description>
